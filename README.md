# BarMath – Barbell Weight Calculator for Apple Watch

**BarMath** makes calculating your barbell weight as easy as lifting it (well, almost)! Designed specifically for Apple Watch, it lets lifters skip the mental math and stay focused on their workout. Whether you're training for strength, powerlifting, or just trying to hit your PR, BarMath is the fast, intuitive tool you didn't know you needed.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Features

* **Instant Calculations**
  Add your bar weight, select plates, and see your total instantly.

* **Wrist-First Experience**
  Fully Apple Watch-native—no iPhone needed during your workout.

* **Clean, Minimal UI**
  Big, readable numbers. No clutter. Just the total weight you need.

## 📲 How It Works

1. **Set Your Bar Weight** – Choose your default bar (e.g., 45 lb, 35lb).
2. **Add Plates** – Tap a plate to add it. Tap multiple times to add multiples of the same plate.
3. **Automatic Doubling** – The app mirrors your selected plates for both sides of the bar.
4. **See Your Total** – Bar weight + plates = your total barbell weight.
